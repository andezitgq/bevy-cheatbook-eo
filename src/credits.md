a number of folks have made significant contributions to help! Thank you
all so much! ❤️

Big thanks to all [sponsors]! ❤️ You all are making this pay off, literally!

Thanks to you, I can actually keep working on this book, improving and maintaining it!

And of course, the biggest thanks goes to the [Bevy project][project::bevy]
itself and its founder, `@cart`, for creating this awesome community and
game engine in the first place! It makes all of this possible. You literally
changed my life! ❤️
