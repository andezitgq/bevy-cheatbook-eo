Rust offers two different toolchains for building for Windows:
 - [MSVC](#first-time-setup-msvc): the default when working in Windows, requires downloading Microsoft SDKs
 - [GNU](#first-time-setup-gnu): alternative MINGW-based build, may be easier to setup

## First-Time Setup (MSVC)

### Rust Toolchain (MSVC)

You can actually use the same MSVC-based Rust toolchain, that is the standard
when working on Windows, from Linux.

Add the target to your Rust installation (assuming you use [`rustup`][rustup]):

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

This installs the files Rust needs to compile for Windows, including the
Rust standard library.

### Microsoft Windows SDKs

You need to install the Microsoft Windows SDKs, just like when working on
Windows. On Linux, this can be done with an easy script called `xwin`. You
need to accept Microsoft's proprietary license.

Install `xwin`:

```sh
cargo install xwin
```

Now, use `xwin` to accept the Microsoft license, download all the files
from Microsoft servers, and install them to a directory of your choosing.

For example, to install to `/opt/xwin/`:

```sh
xwin --accept-license 1 splat --output /opt/xwin
```

### Linking (MSVC)

Rust needs to know how to link the final EXE file.

The default Microsoft linker (`link.exe`) is not available on Linux. Instead,
we need to use the LLD linker (this is also recommended when working on
Windows anyway). Just install the `lld` package from your Linux distro.

We also need to tell Rust the location of the Microsoft Windows SDK libraries
(that were installed with `xwin` in [the previous step](#microsoft-windows-sdks)).

Add this to `.cargo/config.toml` (in your home folder or in your bevy project):

```toml
[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
linker = "lld"
rustflags = [
  "-Lnative=/opt/xwin/crt/lib/x86_64",
  "-Lnative=/opt/xwin/sdk/lib/um/x86_64",
  "-Lnative=/opt/xwin/sdk/lib/ucrt/x86_64"
]
```

## First-Time Setup (GNU)

### Rust Toolchain (GNU)

You can also use the alternative GNU-based Windows toolchain.

Add the target to your Rust installation (assuming you use [`rustup`][rustup]):

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

This installs the files Rust needs to compile for Windows, including the
Rust standard library.

### MINGW

The GNU toolchain requires the MINGW environment to be installed. Your distro likely
provides a package for it. Search your distro for a cross-compilation mingw package.

It might be called something like: `cross-x86_64-w64-mingw32`, but that varies in different distros.

You don't need any files from Microsoft.

## Building Your Project

Finally, with all the setup done, you can just build your Rust/Bevy projects
for Windows:

```sh
cargo build --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release
```

```sh
cargo build --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release
```
